# Dotfiles

Adam Walker's dotfiles for Linux. Uses [dotbot](https://git.io/dotbot).

An older version, with multi-os support is availible on the old-master branch.

NOTE: Before the main install, you should use syncthing to bring over ssh config, keys, and other private items as well as things I didn't want in the repo, like wallpaper.

Configures the following (or may require it to be installed)

- neovim (ripgrep, and maybe others)
- fish
- starship
- hyprland
- waybar (many others required for full use)


## Install

    git clone https://github.com/awalker/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    ./install
